#  NVIM CONFIG

## Authour Noah

This Config is the first one I wrote to get the basis of how to setup / configure and install plugins into neovim.
This was extremely barebones, The keymappings are extremely minimal and the plugins weren't configured to a degree I am happy with. 

# TODO
1. Packer --> lazyvim ( Lazy is so much more convient and used.)
2. Finding the right file explorer ( maybe netrw is the only way)
3. Leap
4. UI Work
